# Structured-Bond-Valuation-and-Hedging
• Priced a structured bond issued by BNP Paribas, decomposing it into a floating-rate note and embedded cap/floor options using the Bachelier model, capturing nonlinear payoff behaviour under capped and floored EURIBOR-linked cashflows.

• Identified pricing inefficiency in a structured BNP Paribas bond by comparing model-derived clean value (€999.20) to market price (€984.30), revealing market-implied credit risk not captured in base assumptions.

• Quantified credit risk through CVA modelling, applying CDS-based survival probabilities and recovery assumptions to adjust valuation and extract credit spread sensitivity (€0.20 per bp).

• Designed macro-hedging strategies using interest rate swaps (DV01-aligned hedge ratio of 95.79%) and CDS to neutralize exposure to level risk and issuer credit risk, guided by sensitivity and VaR/ES analysis.
